| --- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ---- |
| 1  | Michael   | Scott    | 65     | Sales|
| 2  | Dwight    | Schrute  | 75     | Sales|
| 3  | Toby      | Flenderson| 80    | HR  |
| 4  | Jim       | Halpert  | 90     | Sales|
| 5  | Oscar     | Martinez | 90     | Accounting |
| 6  | Angela    | Martin   | 75     | Accounting |
| 7  | Kevin     | Malone   | 70     | Accounting |
| 8  | Holly     | Flax     | 60     | HR |
| 9  | Creed     | Branton  | 70     | Quality Assurance |

* Write a query to find all data in the table
	select * from employees;

* Write a query to find employees with a salary over 75
	select * from employees where salary > 70;

* Write a query to find employees whose first name contains an 'e' or whose last name begins with 'S'\
	select * from employees where firstName like '%e%' and lastName like 'S%';

* Write a query to find the first name of all employees who do not work in accounting
	select firstName from employees where dept not like 'Accounting';

* Write a query to find the average salary of all employees whose last names begin with 'M'
	select avg(salary) from employees where lastName like 'M%';

* Write a query to find the highest paid salesperson
	select * from employees where salary = (select max(salary) from employees) and dept = 'Sales';

* Write a query to combine the resultsets of any two previous queries
	select * from employees where salary > 70
	union
	select * from employees where firstName like '%e%' and lastName like 'S%';

* Remove all members of accounting from the database
	delete from employees where dept = 'Accounting';


* Given removing the dept column from the employees table and creating a table 'department' and linking the two via a foreign key relationship

| dept_id | name |
| ------- | ---  |
| 1       | Sales |
| 2       | HR   |
| 3       | Accounting |
| 4       | Customer Service |

* Write a query to find the salary of the lowest paid salesperson (HINT: use a join)
	select MIN(salary) from employees
	join department on employees.dept_id = department.dept_id
	where name = 'Sales';

* Write a query to find the average salary of each department
	select name, AVG(salary) from employees
	join department on employees.dept_id = department.dept_id
	group by dept_id;

* Write a query to find all possible combinations of employees and departments. How many records do you expect?
	select * from employees
	cross join department;
	I expect to see 36 records.

* Change the name of department 4 to 'Quality Assurance'
	update department 
	set name = 'Quality Assurance' 
	where dept_id = 4;

* Remove both tables
	drop table employees;
	drop table department;

# AWS

### Cloud / AWS Overview
* How would you describe AWS? What is "the cloud" or "cloud computing" and why is it so popular now?
	AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud service that provides computing solutions for customers. 
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
	CC has become popular due to it being more secure. If a device is ever stolen or destroyed a user's
	data remians protected on a remote server in the cloud.

* Define Infrastructure, Platform, and Software as a Service
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a self-service model for managing remote data center infrastructures.
	Platform as a Service (PaaS) allows organizations to build, run and manage applications without the IT infrastructure. This makes it easier and faster to develop, test and deploy applications.
	Software as a service (SaaS) replaces the traditional on-device software with software that is licensed on a subscription basis. It is centrally hosted in the cloud.
	
* What's the difference between a Region and an Availability Zone (AZ)?
	An **AWS Region** is a geographical location with a collection of availability zones mapped to physical data centers in that region. Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply, etc.
 	An availability zone is a logical data center in a region available for use by any AWS customer. Each zone in a region has redundant and separate power, networking and connectivity to reduce the likelihood of two zones failing simultaneously.
* How are you charged for using AWS services? Does it vary by service?
 
* Different ways to interact with AWS services?
	RDS used for hosting a db on AWS
	EC2 is a virtual machine on the cloud
	AMI is a template that contains software configuration required to launch your instance
	EBS is Block Storage associated with an ECS, it acts as a virtual hard drive
	Security Groups details what traffic is allowed in and out and acts as a firewall



### EC2

* What are the configuration options for EC2?
	AMI is where the user selects the template to be used for the instance
	Instance where the user selects the type of processor
	Security Group where the user can configure what traffic is allowed in and out
	keypair is used for authentication in order to access the EC2
 
* What are the different EC2 instance sizes/types?
	instance types define the hardware in which the AMI is using. Some of these types include
	t2.nano, t2.micro, t2.small, m5.large, m5.xlarge, m52xlarge, a1.medium, a1.large, and a1xlarge.
 
* Once you create an EC2, how to connect to it?
	One of the ways to connect to the EC2 is through the terminal via ssh
	ssh -i "keypair.pem" ec2-user@[ec2-filepath]
 
* What are Security Groups? When defining a rule for a security group, what 3 things do you need to specify?
  	Security Groups act as a virtual firewall. They enable rules to filter traffic to the instance.
	The three things needed for security groups are type of connection, protocol, and IP version.

* What's the difference between scalability, elasticity, and resiliency?
	Scalability is the ability of the system to accommodate larger loads just by adding resources either making hardware stronger (scale up) or 
	adding additional nodes (scale out). 
	Elasticity is the ability to fit the resources needed to cope with loads dynamically usually in relation to scale out.
	Cloud resiliency is the process of foreseeing possible disruptions to technology service at a business.
 
* Ways of paying for EC2?
	There are five ways to pay for Amazon EC2 instances: On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. 
	You can also pay for Dedicated Hosts which provide you with EC2 instance capacity on physical servers dedicated for your use.

### RDS

* What's an RDS?
	Amazon Relational Database Service is a distributed relational database service by Amazon Web Services. 
	It is a web service running "in the cloud" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications.
	
* Which vendors are supported?
	Meyer Distributing.
	Earl Owen Company.
	Keystone Automotive.
	H&H Sales.
	Tri-State Enterprises.
	Frank Supply Co.


# UNIX/LINUX

* What are the differences between a Thread and Process and a Service?
	A Thread is a lightweight process, Threads run in a shared memory space
	A Process is a computer program under execution, processes run in a seperate memory space. Processes are isolated and do not 
	interupt each other's execution.
	A service is a program that runs in the background outside the interactive control of system users as they lack an interface.

* Write a basic bash script 
    * ie: installing java/maven/git to an ec2
    * if you're feeling ambitious, a script that would delete a file if it exists
